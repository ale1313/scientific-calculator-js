As the description says, this is just a tiny personal project featuring a scientific calculator.
Includes "funny" features, as a switch button and a shift button, both completely useless in a computer, but whatever.

The original design was taken from [here](http://internetedadinero.com/calculadora-html/calculadora.html), because I was too lazy to make one myself.
